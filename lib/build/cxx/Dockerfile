# THIS FILE HAS BEEN AUTOGENERATED, DO NOT MODIFY IT DIRECTLY!
#
# This file is generated by the script '../local-cxx/setup.sh -d' which manages
# per-target dependencies for all builds that we run with the cxx (C/C++)
# toolchain.
#
# If you are a creating a PR, modify the file 'lib/build/local-cxx/setup.sh',
# then run lib/build/local-cxx/update_cxx_builder.sh to rewrite this file.
#
# If you want to add private dependencies only, add them to the user_deps
# array in the file etc/build/user-cxx.inc.sh, then also run
# lib/build/local-cxx/update_cxx_builder.sh to update this file,
#
# After any modification rebuild the cxx builder image with 'bm-build cxx'.
# The cxx bulder is unversioned, and won't be rebuilt automatically.
