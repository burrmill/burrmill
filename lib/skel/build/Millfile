tar srilm  1.7.3  _SRILM_VER : cxx

# The above line tells two different things to two different, albeit closely
# cooperating processes:
# - Build: check if the tarball named srilm.tar.gz with the version
#   metadatum equal to '1.7.3' exists. If it does not, invoke the command
#   (roughly) 'bm-build srilm _SRILM_VER=1.7.3' to build it.
# - CNS disk assembly: take the file named srilm.tar.gz with the version
#   metadatum equal to '1.7.3', and unpack and integrate it into the CNS disk
#   (or fail, if the build returned successfully but failed to produced one).
# The 'bm-node-software' tool performs both tasks, internally.
# Also note that to build any C/C++ code, you need the cxx buider, so this
# directive must also declare this dependency.

# This is how you mark software you do not want to build. In the case of SRILM,
# you need to obtain a SRILM source tarball after agreeing to the license on
# their Web site, and then put it into a specific bucket; read comments in
# etc/srilm/cloubduild.yaml for details. Then you can enable the build by
# commenting out this line:

skip srilm

# To pin Kaldi to a specific SHA hash on the master branch, use this directive.
# Note that we identify Kaldi revisions with a hash exactly 9 hex digit long.

#ver kaldi feefaaf00
