# This file is not strictly required. When it is absent, 'gcloud build submit'
# will use the contents of .gitignore file when present (and it is). However,
# it prints a long-winded and somewhat confusing message about "some" files
# not being sent for build, directing to a log that may or may not exist.
# We suggest using this exact file in any build directory that contains a
# .gitignore file, the only purpose being is to suppress the warning.

.gitignore
#!include:.gitignore
