This is a baseline layout for a BurrMill Debian 10 image. It excludes all
compute-related stuff. Nothing special about this separation, except this
can be used as a general image, should a need arise.

It used to serve as a baseline for another image for an SSH gateway jumhost,
but since IAP was released the SSH gateway is no longer required.
