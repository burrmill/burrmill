# Empty file to mask out a file with same name that comes in some distros. We
# set the elevator to noop in kernel command line, and we journald and do not
# syslog.  The main reason to remove the package file is that it was buggy, an
# attempted resetting the elevator not only on disks, but on partitions also,
# resulting in a slew of logged errors.
