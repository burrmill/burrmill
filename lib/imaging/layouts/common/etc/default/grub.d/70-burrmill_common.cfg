# In order of appearance:
# * Use SCSI multiqueue, recommended by GCE.
# * Leave disk I/O ordering to host; elevator=noop is a VM standard anywhere.
# * Disable "consistent" network interface naming based on the interface card
#   bus and slot. It's not consistent in GCE: e.g., adding a GPU shifts
#   virtio_net interfaces down the virtual PCI bus.
# * Disable vsyscall area, because it's sooo early 1990s.
# * Log info and above level to console from early on.
# * Do not print colored [OK] messages, because literal ANSI color sequences
#   look horrible in logs (but bake sure to remove any vestiges of Plymouth,
#   it forces this bask to 'on':
