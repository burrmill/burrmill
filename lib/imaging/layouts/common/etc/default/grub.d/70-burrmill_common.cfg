# WARNING!
# WARNING! Settings marked with [S] trade mitigations of known CPU
# WARNING! vulnerabilities for performance. These are ONLY for machines
# WARNING! that you fully control!
# WARNING!
#
# Note that I do not fully understand to what degree these mitigations apply to
# GCP VMs. Some may be enforced at the host level, so you'll get no bang out of
# the attempt to disable them.
#
# In order of appearance below:
# * Use SCSI multiqueue, recommended by GCE.
# * Leave disk I/O ordering to host; elevator=noop is a VM standard anywhere.
# * Tighter per-CPU clock sync. Trades performance for power consumption.
# * [S] Enable TSX for improved HPC performance.
# * [S] Disable a bunch of mitigations with a single kernel v5.2+ option.
# * [S] Same as above, but listing options individually for lesser kernels
#        without the 'mitigations=' option.
# * Disable "consistent" network interface naming based on the interface card
#   bus and slot. It's not consistent in GCE: e.g., adding a GPU shifts
#   virtio_net interfaces down the virtual PCI bus.
# * Disable vsyscall area, because it's sooo early 1990s.
# * Log info and above level to console from early on.
# * Do not print colored [OK] messages, because literal ANSI color sequences
#   look horrible in logs (but bake sure to remove any vestiges of Plymouth,
#   it forces this bask to 'on':
