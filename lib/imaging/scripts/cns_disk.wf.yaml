# This Daisy workflow creates a new CNS disk snapshot.
#
# It's very simple and linear. Since Daisy does not have a step for making
# a snapshot, we snapshot the drive from inside the workflow script.
#
# Ubuntu 18.04 is used as the build system, because we need both Docker and
# GCSDK (gcloud, gsutil). There is no suitable stock image that would contain
# both, but Ubuntu's snap installer installs Docker really in a snap, without
# the long initial package database bootstrap required by apt.
#
# Daisy cannot read YAML files, so this file is first converted to JSON by the
# bm-cns-disk tool, which also handles all the required variables to pass to the
# workflow. Additionally, the using of YAML's advanced features (& and *) helps
# make clunky Daisy syntax more readable.
